Our program auto generates manga and anime given two random character names (or any starting sentence).

To use the program, 

1. Open the .ipnyb file in Colab (will need to download large models and do lots of computation, probably not a good idea to run on local machine).

2. Upload the .ttf font file to file - content - sample_data.

3. Change the `main_character` and `second_character` variables to anything you like. 

4. Run through the .ipnyb file step by step. It might take some time to download the models the first time you run it. 

5. Then a PNG file `manga.png` and a video will be generated in Colab: file - content - sample_data. Have a look!
