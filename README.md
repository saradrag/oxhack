# oxhack
Our program auto generates manga and anime given two random character names (or any starting sentence).

To use the program, open the Jupyter file in Colab (will need to download large models and do lots of computation, probably not a good idea to run on local laptop). 
Change the `main_character` and `second_character` variables to generate different stories. 
Go through the Jupyter file. It might take some time to download the models the first time you run it. 
Then a PNG file `manga.png` and a video will be generated in file - content - sample_data. Have a look!
